Noted supports syncing your notes to your [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) account. To do so, simply click the "Sign in to Dropbox" button. You'll be redirected to Dropbox to authorize Noted to use your account.

Noted only utilizes your `/Apps/Noted-App` folder. It exports (saves) by simply replacing all of the files in the `/Apps/Noted-App/notes` folder with your current notes, and imports by replacing your notes in Noted with the files in the `notes` folder.

The files Noted exports are human-readable text files.
